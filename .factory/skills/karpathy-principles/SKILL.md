# Karpathy Principles — Deltas

Two rules distilled from Andrej Karpathy's [viral observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls (via [forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills)), narrowed to what isn't already covered by common coding-assistant rules or the underlying model's defaults.

## Delta 1: Surface Assumptions Before Implementing

LLMs pick an interpretation silently and run with it. Before writing code for a non-trivial task:

- **State assumptions explicitly.** If the request has more than one reasonable interpretation, name them and pick one with a reason — or ask.
- **If scope is implicit, call it out.** "Export users" → all users or a subset? File or API? Which fields? Ask before coding, not after.
- **If a simpler path exists, say so.** Don't silently follow the user's suggestion if it's overkill — present the simpler option and let the user redirect.
- **If confused, stop.** Name what's unclear. "I'm unsure whether X means Y or Z" beats guessing.

**The test:** Could another engineer read the request and build something materially different? If yes, surface the fork before committing to one branch.

## Delta 2: Match Existing Style; Mention Don't Delete

Karpathy: *"Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently. If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it."*

Reconciling with common "delete unused code" advice — that applies to **orphans your changes create**, not pre-existing code:

- **Orphans from your changes:** delete them. Unused imports, variables, functions made dead by your edit are yours to clean up.
- **Pre-existing dead code:** mention it in your summary, don't delete it silently. The user may know something you don't (planned use, historical context, external callers).
- **Style drift:** if the file uses single quotes / no type hints / snake_case, keep it. Don't "improve" on the way through. One-off style choices inside your own new code are fine; reformatting surrounding code is not.
- **Comment/whitespace edits:** only if directly needed for your change. Touching every line you read expands the diff and hides the actual change.

**The test:** Every line in your diff should trace to the stated task. A reviewer asking "why did this line change?" for any hunk should get an answer tied directly to the request.

## What's Deliberately Not Here

- **Simplicity First** (no speculative features, no premature abstraction) — modern coding assistants enforce this by default; don't re-state.
- **Goal-Driven Execution** (tests-first, verify-then-loop) — see the `testing` skill; a mandatory RED-GREEN-REFACTOR rule is stronger than Karpathy's "consider tests-first" framing.
