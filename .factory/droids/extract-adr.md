      From the session log above, extract the architectural decisions and format them as
      proper ADRs following the **`adr` skill** (`.factory/skills/adr/SKILL.md`) — the
      canonical convention. One decision per ADR. Use this exact template:

      # ADR-NNNN: <short imperative title>

      - **Status:** Proposed
      - **Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD from the session log, or ask>
      - **Deciders:** <who, from the log>
      - **Related requirements:** FR-###   (omit if none — enables trace-check)
      - **Related ADRs:** ADR-NNNN (omit if none)

      ## Context
      The forces at play: problem, constraints, what made the decision necessary.

      ## Decision
      "We will …" — active voice, one decision.

      ## Consequences
      - **Positive:** what this enables.
      - **Negative:** what it costs or risks.   (required — never omit)
      - **Neutral:** follow-on work, things now locked in.

      ## Alternatives considered
      - Each realistic option and the one-line reason it lost.

      Generate one ADR per significant decision. Concrete, specific, architecturally
      significant only. Leave NNNN as a placeholder — the next step assigns the number.
