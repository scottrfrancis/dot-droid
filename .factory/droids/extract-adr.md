      From the session log above, extract the architectural decisions and format them as proper ADRs.

      For each significant decision, create an ADR following this template:

      # ADR-XXX: [Title]

      ## Status
      Proposed

      ## Context
      What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

      ## Decision
      What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

      ## Consequences
      What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

      ### Positive
      - List positive consequences

      ### Negative
      - List negative consequences

      ### Neutral
      - List neutral consequences

      ## Alternatives Considered
      - What other options were evaluated?

      ---

      Generate one or more ADRs based on the key decisions found in the log.
      Use concrete, specific language and focus on architectural significance.
